# Tiffany Duong's Data Science Portfolio
This portfolio is a compliation of notebooks that I have created over the course of my studies for my Masters in Data Science at Northwestern University as well as personal/side projects<br>

## Data Cleansing and Preparation
### BestDeal Transactional Data
[Github](https://github.com/tiffduong/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/MSDS%20-%20Database%20Systems%20%26%20Preparation/Assignment_2_-_Data_Preparation_and_Cleansing.ipynb "Github") | [Nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tiffduong/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/MSDS%20-%20Database%20Systems%20%26%20Preparation/Assignment_2_-_Data_Preparation_and_Cleansing.ipynb "Nbviewer")

An exercise of cleaning transactional data, loading it onto a sqlite engine and executing SQL queries.


## Data Exploration and Analysis
### MSPA Software Survey 
[Github](https://github.com/tiffduong/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/MSDS%20-%20Practical%20Machine%20Learning/Assignment_1_-_MSPA_Software_Survey_Analysis/Assignment_1.ipynb "Github") | [Nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tiffduong/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/MSDS%20-%20Practical%20Machine%20Learning/Assignment_1_-_MSPA_Software_Survey_Analysis/Assignment_1.ipynb "Nbviewer")

I explored data results from a survey given to the MSPA program back in 2016. I analyzed current students' course interests and programming language/software usage to gauge and assess future curriculum planning for the MSDS program.

## NoSQL Databases
### Chicago Food Inspection
[Github](https://github.com/tiffduong/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/MSDS%20-%20Database%20Systems%20%26%20Preparation/Assignment_1_-_Querying_Data_Stored_on_a_NoSQL_Database.ipynb"Github") | [Nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tiffduong/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/MSDS%20-%20Database%20Systems%20%26%20Preparation/Assignment_1_-_Querying_Data_Stored_on_a_NoSQL_Database.ipynb "Nbviewer")

I executed and experimented with queries to pull data of varying degrees of precision/relevance from a NoSQL document-oriented database engine ElasticSearch to assess the current state of failed sanitary inspections in buildings categorized as "children's facilities", such as daycares in the city of Chicago.
