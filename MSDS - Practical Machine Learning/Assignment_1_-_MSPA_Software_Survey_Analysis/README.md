# Assignment 1: MSPA Software Survey Analysis
## Prompt
Imagine that you are an academic administrator responsible for defining the future direction of the graduate program. <br>
The MSPA Survey has been designed with these objectives in mind:<br>
>What are current students' software preferences? <br>
What are students' interests in potential new courses? <br>
Guide software and systems planning for current and future courses. <br>
Guide data science curriculum planning. <br>

## Conclusion
A MSPA Software Survey was collected in December 2016 and it was given to graduate students within the MSPA program. 
Data from the survey was used to help with the data science program curriculum planning.<br>

Among survey takers, it seems like there was a good mix of students, almost equally for those halfway 
through the program (>6 courses) and those not yet completed more than half of the program (<6 courses). 
The majority of the students that took the survey were from the more immediate graduating classes, with the 
majority of them graduating in Spring 2018.<br>

The survey asked of exposure and usage for software languages between the three categories: 
Professional, Industry, and Personal. Across all three categories, R was the predominant preferred language, 
with Python closely following second, and JS, HTML, and CSS used the least.<br>

In terms of Course Interest, there were four options to decide from 0-100 for each in terms of interest. The four options were Python, 
Foundations DE, Analytics App, and Systems Analysis. Python had the highest percentage of course interest with 73.5%, followed by 
Foundations DE (58.0%), Analytics App (55.2%), and Systems Analysis (53.6%).<br>

My recommendation would be to implement more coursework into the program that uses Python. Not only is Python a course and personal 
interest, but data shows that usage of Python is high for the industry and professional segments. With approximately half of the survey 
takers not having completed half of the program, interest in Python is not fleeting and it may be possible to implement more Python in 
the program, and possibly parallel courses in R if the budget and enough interest allows. If debating between Python or R for program 
usage, an additional survey can be sent out for survey takers to indicate a narrowed preference.<br>
