# Practical Machine Learning
This repository contains all of my projects/coursework for Practical Machine Learning (MSDS 422) of Northwestern University's Masters in Data Science program. 
Each assignment contains a brief assignment overview write-up containing key insights.

## Assignment 1: MSPA Software Survey Analysis
### Management Questions
Imagine that you are an academic administrator responsible for defining the future direction of the graduate program. <br>
The MSPA Survey has been designed with these objectives in mind:<br>
>What are current students' software preferences? <br>
What are students' interests in potential new courses? <br>
Guide software and systems planning for current and future courses. <br>
Guide data science curriculum planning.

## Assignment 2: Evaluating Classification Models
### Management Questions
Use three binary explanatory variables relating to client banking history: default, housing, and loan. <br>
Predict the binary response variable: <br>
>Has the client subscribed to a term deposit? <br>
>Use all banking client observations with complete data for these study variables<br>

Employ two classification methods: <br>
>(1) logistic regression<br>
>(2) na√Øve Bayes classification <br>

Evaluate these methods within a cross-validation design, using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve as an index of classification performance.
