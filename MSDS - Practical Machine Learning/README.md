## Assignment 1: MSPA Software Survey Analysis
### Management Questions
Imagine that you are an academic administrator responsible for defining the future direction of the graduate program. <br>
The MSPA Survey has been designed with these objectives in mind:<br>
>What are current students' software preferences? <br>
What are students' interests in potential new courses? <br>
Guide software and systems planning for current and future courses. <br>
Guide data science curriculum planning.

## Assignment 2: Evaluating Classification Models
### Management Questions
Imagine that you are advising the bank about machine learning methods to guide telephone marketing campaigns. Which of the two modeling methods would you recommend and why? And, given the results of your research, which group of banking clients appears to be the best target for direct marketing efforts (similar to those used with previous telephone campaigns)? <br>
> Employ two classification models (Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes)<br>
> Evaluate these models with a cross validation design<br>
> Use the area under the ROC curve as an index of classification performance<br>
