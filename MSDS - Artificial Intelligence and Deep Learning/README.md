# MSDS 458 - Artificial Intelligence & Deep Learning
><sup>Description: An introduction to the field of artificial intelligence, this course illustrates probability-rule-based generative models as well as discriminative models that learn from training data. The course reviews applications of artificial intelligence and deep learning in vision and language processing. Students learn best practices for building supervised learning models and, in particular, deep neural networks for classification and regression. Students also learn about feature engineering, autoencoders, and strategies of unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, as well as reinforcement learning. </sup>

## Assignment 2: Finding Natural Feature Sets
>Prompt: Investigate how a deep neural network inteprets features and to experiment and identify the natural feature sets within the hidden layer.

## Final Project: Distracted Drivers Detection
>Prompt: For this project, you will have chosen a research question and developed an appropriate network. You will have gathered and preprocessed your data, designed and refined your network structure, trained and tested the network, varied the hyperparameters to improve performance, and analyzed / assessed the results.
