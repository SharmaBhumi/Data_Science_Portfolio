# MSDS 458 - Artificial Intelligence & Deep Learning
><sup>Description: An introduction to the field of artificial intelligence, this course illustrates probability-rule-based generative models as well as discriminative models that learn from training data. The course reviews applications of artificial intelligence and deep learning in vision and language processing. Students learn best practices for building supervised learning models and, in particular, deep neural networks for classification and regression. Students also learn about feature engineering, autoencoders, and strategies of unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, as well as reinforcement learning. </sup>

## Assignment 1: Classifier Neural Network
Prompt: Investigate how the hidden nodes in a simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) learn to identify differentiating features in the input data, allowing them to classify the inputs into the appropriate pre-determined classes.
