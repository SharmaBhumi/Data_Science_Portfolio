# MSDS 420 - Database Systems & Preparation
> This repository contains all of my projects/coursework for Database Systems & Preparation (MSDS 420) of Northwestern University's Masters in Data Science program.

## Assignment 1: Querying Data Stored on a NoSQL Database
> A Chicago Tribune watchdog report from 2016 reported that the city of Chicago had only 33 working field inspectors to cover the entire city of Chicago. Many of the facilties serve food for Children, and while few fail inspectionns, many escape routine inspections.

> This is a classic resource allocation problem. In this assignment, our goal is to identify the **hot-spots** (areas that have facilities serving food to children and have failed inspections in the past) on the Chicago map to dispatch inspectors to.

> To achieve our goal, we need the following:
> 1. Dataset for Chicago Food Inspections
> 2. NoSQL database Egnine (ElasticSearch) for indexing and data retrieval
> 3. HeatMap to plot the children facilties that failed Chicago Food Inspections
