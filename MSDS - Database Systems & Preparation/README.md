# MSDS 420 - Database Systems & Preparation
><sup><i>In this course students explore the fundamental concepts of database management and data preparation. With a focus on applications in large-scale data analytics projects, the course introduces relational database systems, the relational model, normalization process, and structured query language (SQL). The course discusses topics related to data integration and cleaning, database programming for extract, transform, and load (ETL) operations. Students learn NoSQL technologies for working with unstructured data and document-oriented information retrieval systems. They learn how to index and score documents for effective and relevant responses to user queries. Students acquire hands-on programming experience for data preparation and data extraction using various data sources and file formats.</sup></i>

This repository contains all of my projects/coursework for Database Systems & Preparation (MSDS 420) of Northwestern University's Masters in Data Science program.

## Assignment 1: Querying Data Stored on a NoSQL Database
> A Chicago Tribune watchdog report from 2016 reported that the city of Chicago had only 33 working field inspectors to cover the entire city of Chicago. Many of the facilties serve food for Children, and while few fail inspectionns, many escape routine inspections.

> This is a classic resource allocation problem. In this assignment, our goal is to identify the **hot-spots** (areas that have facilities serving food to children and have failed inspections in the past) on the Chicago map to dispatch inspectors to.

> To achieve our goal, we need the following:
> 1. Dataset for Chicago Food Inspections
> 2. NoSQL database Egnine (ElasticSearch) for indexing and data retrieval
> 3. HeatMap to plot the children facilties that failed Chicago Food Inspections

## Assignment 2: Data Cleansing & Preparation
> As a data scientist for BestDeal retailer, you have been tasked with improving their revenue and the effectiveness of the marketing campaign of their electronic products. The given dataset has 10,000 records for the purchases of their customers and is used to predict customers shopping patterns and to provide answers for ad-hoc queries. The dataset DirtyData4BestDeal10000.csv is drawn from its database of customers.

> In this exercise, the goals are to:
> - Analyze the dataset in the given CSV file
> - Clean the given dataset
> - Load the dataset into sqlite database engine
> - Execute different SQL queries
> - Data Preparation
