# MSDS 462 - Computer Vision
><sup>Description: A review of specialized deep learning methods for vision, including convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Students work with raw image files, including digital representations of photographs, hand-written documents, x-rays, and sensor images. Students process image data, converting pixels into numeric tensors for subsequent analysis and modeling. The course illustrates real-world applications for visual exploration, discovery and navigation, and for image classification, facial recognition, remote sensing, and medical diagnostics.

## Assignment 1: Classication Model with Fashion MNIST data
>Prompt: Train a classification model for the Fashion MNIST Kaggle Project either on Kaggle or using a Colab notebook with Kaggle Data.
